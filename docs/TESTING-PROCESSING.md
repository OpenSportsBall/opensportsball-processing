# Testing the processing pipeline

How the follow cam, the pitch map and the ball tracking are measured, what the
measurements say today, and how to extend them. Everything here runs locally
on the Phase 0 spikes in `processing/spikes/`. See `docs/BACKLOG.md` for the
history of what was tried and `docs/TESTING-APPS.md` for the phone apps.

## Principles

- **Footage is private.** It shows people, some possibly minors. Every label
  set, fixture and rendered clip lives under `footage/` (gitignored) and never
  enters the repository. Back them up privately; the tooling and the numbers
  are what the repo keeps.
- **Score against reviewed labels, not by eye.** Each algorithm change is run
  through the harness below before a render. Watching renders is for judging
  what to label next, not for deciding between variants.
- **Small sets are noisy.** 13 play moments and 90 ball moments: a difference
  of one or two is noise. Treat them as a direction, and add moments before
  tuning further.

## 1. Pitch and goal mapping

`processing/tests/test_pitch_regression.py` reruns the whole mapping (line
fit from the starting guess, goal detection, refit with the goals) on saved
background panoramas and compares it with a result that was checked by eye.

    uv run --with pytest --with numpy --with scipy --with opencv-python-headless --with torch \
        pytest processing/tests/test_pitch_regression.py -v

Fixtures: `footage/fixtures/pitch/<name>/` (`background.png`, `expected.json`),
or `$OSB_PITCH_FIXTURES`. The test skips when none exist. Make one from a
recording whose `pitch.json` and `goals.json` you have verified:

    uv run processing/spikes/pitch.py footage/rec3 fixture footage/fixtures/pitch/<name>

Tolerances: both goals found and within 0.3 m; goal frames within 1.5 px of
the white structure and end markings within 3.5 px of the paint; pitch
length and width within 1 m, camera height within 0.2 m; 15 key points
(corners, centre and penalty spots, post bases and tops) within 0.1 deg,
the lines-only fit within 0.3 deg. One fixture so far: the night game.

## 2. Follow cam: must-see boxes

A reviewer draws, on a full-resolution panorama of a moment, the part of the
field a follow cam has to show. A camera path is scored by how much of each
box it shows at that frame.

| Step | Command |
|---|---|
| Panoramas at chosen clip times | `uv run processing/spikes/playeval.py make footage/rec3 <set> <segment> <start s> <clip t> ...` |
| Draw and review boxes | preview `play-eval` / `play-eval-seg9` (`processing/spikes/evalpage/server.py <set dir> [port]`) |
| Score path files | `uv run processing/spikes/playeval.py score footage/rec3 <set> <path.json> ...` |
| Bench many variants | `uv run processing/spikes/playbench.py footage/rec3 [variant ...]` |

Sets: `footage/rec3/playeval/<set>/` with `pano/`, `items.json`,
`boxes.json` (panorama degrees, so boxes don't depend on any render) and
`paths/<variant>.json` plus `<variant>_debug.json` (per-frame mode, aim,
hotspot, ball). Two sets, 13 reviewed moments: `seg9-60` (segment 9 from
60 s, the first test clip) and `seg3-225` (segment 3 from 225 s, crossing
into segment 4).

`playbench.py` caches follow.py's pass A (player detections) per clip in
`footage/rec3/follow/passA_<seg>_<start>_<seconds>.json`, so a variant
plans in seconds. Variants are follow.py feature strings; a feature
`NAME=value` overrides a constant for that run (`MIN_HFOV=50`,
`ball.MIN_JUDGE=0`). `OSB_BALL_TAG` selects the ball candidate file
(`win` for ballwin.py's; unset prefers it when present).

A moment counts as captured when at least 98% of its box is in view. The
bench also reports mean coverage and the median view width (narrower is
better once captured, down to the resolution floor: a 1080p view narrower
than ~55 deg upsamples the 4K source).

Results on the 13 moments (2026-10-17):

| Configuration | Captured | Width (median) |
|---|---|---|
| A: `goalkick,goalframe,unsure` (players only) | 4/13 | 54 deg |
| A + 50 deg floor + edge rule, no ball | 5/13 | 59 deg |
| A + ball + goalin (full-scan candidates) | 9-10/13 | 54 deg |
| **A2: `goalkick,goalframe,unsure,ball,goalin,ballhold`**, ballwin candidates, 50 deg floor, edge rule | **11/13** | 63 deg |

Misses: the seg 9 goal kick at 1:10 (ball in the keeper's hands, 76%) and
seg 3's opening seconds (95%). Tried and not adopted: lead, nowalk,
fastboost, weak, allnear, flow, lone, gk2, netevent (each in the backlog).

Add moments by appending clip times to `playeval.py make` for an existing
set (it keeps the others) or making a new set from another stretch of the
game; `playbench.py` lists the clips in `CLIPS`.

## 3. Ball tracking: clip labels

The ball's position every 2 s along a clip, labelled on both phones, so the
tracker is measured directly (found / wrong / missed) rather than through
the play boxes.

| Step | Command |
|---|---|
| Build a clip set | `uv run processing/spikes/labelset.py footage/rec3 clip <name> <segment> <start s> <seconds> [step s]` |
| Label it | preview `ball-labels-seg9` / `ball-labels-seg3` (`processing/spikes/label/server.py footage/rec3/labels_<name> [port]`) |
| Score the tracker | `uv run processing/spikes/balleval.py footage/rec3 <name> ["NAME=value,..." ...]` |

Sets: `footage/rec3/labels_<name>/` (`items.json`, `images/`, `pano/`,
`labels.json` with every ball marked and the match ball flagged). Two sets
of 60 moments: `seg9` (37 with the match ball on the pitch) and `seg3` (53).
The clip's candidates come from the files below; the set's suggestions are
drawn from them.

A hit is an estimate within 3 m + 5% of the ball's distance from the camera
(placing a far ball on the pitch is uncertain in depth; `OSB_HIT_M`,
`OSB_HIT_PER_M` to vary). Moments labelled "none" (ball not visible) and
"unsure" are not counted as wrong.

Candidate sources, all in `footage/rec3/detect/ball_<seg>_<start>_<seconds>.<tag>.json`:

| Tag | Script | What |
|---|---|---|
| (none) | `ballclip.py` | fine-tuned RF-DETR on every 640 px tile, 10 fps (~30 min per 2 min clip) |
| `win` | `ballwin.py` | the same detector in search windows around the predicted ball, full scans every 2 s or when lost (~6.5 min per 2 min clip); the default source |
| `flow` | `flowcands.py` | motion-only candidates (double difference, size, consistent step); also writes the goal-net change series `net_*.json` |

Every candidate carries a `judge` score from `balljudge.py` (a 48 px crop
classifier; `data`, `train`, `eval`, `clip`). `ballcompare.py` compares the
stock and fine-tuned detectors on the random label set's held-back frames.

Results at the labelled moments (tracker defaults as of 2026-10-17):

| Candidates | seg 9 found | seg 3 found | wrong |
|---|---|---|---|
| tracker before tuning (4 s static filter, 3 hits, no judge) | 32% | 26% | 9 / 12 |
| tuned defaults, full-scan candidates | 54% | 62% | 1 / 8 |
| tuned defaults, `win` candidates | 49-51% | 58% | 2-4 / 7-8 |

The candidate ceiling (a usable candidate near the ball at all) is ~62% of
moments; the misses are mostly balls under 8 px, 43-100+ m away. Witnesses
from other motion (keeper bearings, motion blobs, net ripple, facing
direction: `witness.py`, `flowcands.py`, `facing.py`) were scored the same
way and none raises the found-rate; the backlog has their numbers.
